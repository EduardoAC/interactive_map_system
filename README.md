# Iteractive Map System
## Introduction
I wanted to create a interactive map system that allow me to make easier and faster 
develop my personal projects. 

Therefore I looked on Internet for a open source system
that allow me to create itinerary system based to find ["Flight Animation with d3.js"] (http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2014-04-02)
and ["Interactive Map with d3.js"](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-12-07) by [Tom Noda](http://www.tnoda.com).

Based on his work I decided to start my own github repository that will have an advance version of his work.
